		<h2> What does your SPARK Saturdays program consist of? </h2>
		<p> Currently, SPARK Saturdays is structured to be four or five sessions, held every other Saturday. Each 
			session will last about two hours and consist of a learning portion and a hands-on activity, 
			led by CMU students. The SPARK Saturdays program is held once every semester, and aimed at high school 
			students. No prior knowledge on the part of the students is assumed. The sessions are 
			structured to introduce students to a wide variety of electrical and computer engineering 
			concepts to help them decide whether this is a career for them.  </p>
		<h2>What is the history of this SPARK Saturdays?</h2>
		<p>We began creating sessions in Fall 2012, and held our first two sessions in Spring 2013. We are hoping to keep expanding in the future. 
			Professor Sullivan is the faculty sponsor at CMU for SPARK Saturdays. </p>
		<h2>How do I sign up for the SPARK Saturdays program?</h2>
		<p>The Application page contains the application and the relevant information and deadlines 
			about applying for SPARK Saturdays. Unfortunately, due to limited resources we're not able to 
			accept all applicants, but we're making every effort to expand SPARK Saturdays. </p>
		<h2>Can I use your materials?</h2>
		<p>Yes, our materials are free for public use. If you do decide to use them, please send us an email or use our <a href="contactUs.html">Contact Us<a/> page to let us know because we'd love to hear about how our sessions are being used!</p>
		<h2>How do I become a volunteer?</h2>
		<p>We are always in need of more volunteers to do everything from helping run the sessions to 
			creating lab modules to generating publicity to contacting sponsors. We'd love to have you work with us. 
			Please use the <a href="contactUs.html">Contact Us<a/> page to get in touch with us and express your interest and you'll hear 
			back from us very soon.</p>
