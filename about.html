                <h1>About Us</h1>

                <h2> What programs do you run? </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we run two programs, <a href="/spark-saturdays.html"><strong>SPARK Saturdays</strong></a> and <a href="/mobile-labs.html"><strong>Mobile Labs</strong></a>, specifically geared toward high school and middle school students.
                </p>

                <h2> What do your programs consist of? </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, <strong>SPARK Saturdays</strong> is structured to be around 4-5 lab sessions, held on
                    campus about every Saturday. Each session will last about two hours and consist of a learning portion
                    and a hands-on activity, led by CMU students. The entire SPARK Saturdays program is held once every
                    semester, and aimed at high school students. No prior knowledge on the part of the students is assumed.
                    The sessions are structured to introduce students to a wide variety of electrical and computer engineering
                    concepts to help them decide whether this might be a good career path for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our <strong>Mobile Labs</strong> program is an adaptation of SPARK Saturdays, still geared toward
                    high school students, but that we bring to schools. The labs are held after school on an average weekday
                    to interested students.
                </p>

                <h2>What is the history of your programs?</h2>
                <p>
                    We began creating sessions for the SPARK Saturdays program in Fall 2012, and held our first two sessions
                    in Spring 2013. In Spring 2015 we expanded our reach to middle school students and local high schools
                    through the Snap Circuit Lab and the Mobile Labs programs, respectively. We hope to keep expanding in
                    the future. Professor Tom Sullivan has been the faculty sponsor at CMU for ECE Outreach since its onset.
                </p>
